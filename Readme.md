# ublock obnoxiousness filter

- Some stories, with their celebrity/outrage/shock value/click-bait... monopolize information channels without providing value. 
- [ublock origins](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is an amazing tool for selectively filtering out unwanted pieces of web pages; used primarily as an ad blocker.
- Here, I have repurposed it as an obnoxiousness filter by adding rules to filter out things I do not want to see. 


Load it with ublock settings -> filter lists -> import -> [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunsupe/ublock-filters/main/ublock-filters.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunsupe/ublock-filters/main/ublock-filters.txt)
